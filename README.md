**CRC USER**

This is a playbook to set up the htpasswd identity provider when using CRC (CodeReady Containers).
It will work with any OpenShift cluster.

I took what had been done in this [blog post]([https://link](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/03/automate-workshop-setup-with-ansible-playbooks-and-codeready-workspaces/)) and turned it into an ansible playbook.
